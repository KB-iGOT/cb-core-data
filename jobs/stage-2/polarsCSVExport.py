"""
polars_csv_export.py — standalone job, NO Spark/findspark imports.

Each report's Spark job writes a PLAIN (non-partitioned) parquet file and
then stops. This script runs AFTER that job has fully exited, reads the
plain parquet, and does the per-org split + CSV write using Polars.

CHANGES vs the previous version (all marked "CHANGED" below):
  1. MEMORY: the old code did pl.read_parquet() of the whole file and then
     df.partition_by(), which copies every row into per-org frames while the
     full frame is still alive -> peak memory ~2x the dataset. At 220M rows
     (ACBP enrolment) the Linux OOM killer sent SIGKILL (exit -9, no stderr).
     Now the file is processed in hash-bucketed chunks of at most
     MAX_ROWS_PER_CHUNK rows. Each org lives in exactly one chunk, so output
     is identical, but peak memory is bounded by the chunk size.
  2. RERUN SAFETY: the old code wiped EVERY report's output dir up front and
     deleted each report's input parquet right after it succeeded. A rerun
     after a crash therefore destroyed finished output AND the input needed
     to rebuild it. Now an output dir is only wiped immediately before it is
     rewritten (and never when its input is missing), and input parquet is
     only deleted after the whole run succeeds.
  3. INTEGRITY: rows written are checked against rows in the source.
  4. LOGGING: line-buffered output + peak memory per report, so the last log
     line before a kill is trustworthy and memory growth is visible.
  5. EXIT CODE: a failing report no longer stops the others; the job still
     exits non-zero at the end so Airflow marks it failed.

HOW TO ADD A NEW REPORT:
  1. In that report's Spark job, replace its CSV-writing step with a plain
     parquet write (no partitionBy, no coalesce(1)) to a STABLE path (not
     auto-cleaned by that job).
  2. Add ONE entry to get_reports() below with that path, the output dir,
     partition column, and csv filename. Do not create a new file per report.

Usage:
    python3 polars_csv_export.py                  # run every registered report
    python3 polars_csv_export.py --only cba        # run only reports whose name contains "cba"
    python3 polars_csv_export.py --no-cleanup      # keep the plain parquet after export (debugging)
    python3 polars_csv_export.py --max-rows-per-chunk 20000000   # lower if memory is still tight
